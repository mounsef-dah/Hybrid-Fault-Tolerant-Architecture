# Implementation of a Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Architecture in Hardware Description Language(VHDL)

## Overview

This project aims to implement a Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Architecture using hardware description language (HDL). The architecture is designed to withstand various types of faults, including transient and permanent faults, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system.

## Features

- Implementation of fault detection mechanisms.
- Integration of fault recovery strategies.
- Utilization of redundancy techniques for fault tolerance.
- Performance evaluation under fault conditions.
- Scalability and flexibility in fault handling.

## Technologies Used

- Hardware Description Language (HDL) (e.g., Verilog, VHDL)
- Simulation tools : Xilinx Vivado
- Testing and verification tools : test benches
