# Implementation of a Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Architecture in Hardware Description Language (VHDL)

## Overview

This project aims to implement a Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Architecture using hardware description language (HDL). The architecture is designed to withstand various types of faults, including transient and permanent faults, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system.

## Implementation

In this project, we implemented the architecture proposed by Tran (2011) using hardware description language (HDL). Below are some key details of the implementation:

- **Architecture Design**: We followed the architectural design described in Tran's thesis, incorporating fault detection mechanisms and fault recovery strategies.

- **Fault Injection**: We conducted fault injection experiments to evaluate the robustness of the architecture under various fault conditions. An example of a fault injection setup is shown below:

- **Principal Architecture Representation**: The architecture is represented in the `src/principal.vhd` file code. This file serves as the main implementation of the fault-tolerant architecture.

- **Simulation File Test Bench**: The simulation file test bench is `sim/principal_tb.vhd`, which is used for testing and verification of the implemented architecture.

- **Performance Evaluation**: We performed performance evaluation tests to assess the effectiveness of the fault-tolerant mechanisms in the architecture.
